- Keep imported homepage markup and React-driven interaction repair in its route file, preserving captured CSS and local source assets to maintain source fidelity.
- Homepage door gestures finish before opening; cancel touch compatibility clicks and keep shelves inert through the curtain transition so opening cannot select a book.
- Preserve original same-site paths on the app origin, including links to pages not yet imported, so later imports can use the original URLs.
- Audited resource pages use one legacy-path route with an explicit source-derived manifest and lazy per-page data; accept matching source structures only to prevent silent layout changes.
- Preserve original resource CSS and use source variants of the shared Button for repaired controls; load the original flipbook viewer on demand to retain familiar file viewing.
- Catalog PDF View buttons invoke the existing overlay callback; titles and non-PDF View links retain contextual dedicated routes so immediate reading and shareable pages coexist.
- Keep advertising and analytics disabled in previews; preserve verified publisher configuration separately until the published domain and consent requirements are validated.
- Additional legacy pages use the same explicit-path route with lazy page data and content-addressed source fragments; share only identical fragments so unusual source layouts remain intact.
- Rebuild legacy catalogs with scripts/import-legacy-pages.py from audited source files; never execute embedded source scripts, and record unavailable source catalogs/assets rather than inventing replacements.
- Catalogs use editable static JSON: exact-path manifests select layout-only pages, ordered document IDs resolve lazy shared shards, and the hierarchy indexes only source-address categories; this preserves URLs/order without a database. Audited inline snapshots are kept outside src under .site-import/catalog-source; normalize-catalogs.py is an explicit re-import conversion, never a page-load or automatic edit-time overwrite.
- The root LibraryShell owns the uniform app bar and source-derived class menu; route renderers omit captured navigation and scoped layout overrides remove legacy offsets so every page shares navigation without modifying source content or URL mappings.
- LibraryShell coordinates navigation state through stable callbacks; memoized AppBar, AdminProfile, SideDrawer, and NavTree preserve captured markup and isolate unrelated redraws without changing source links or CSS.
- Class navigation uses one controlled ancestor path, clears it on selection/navigation, and never re-expands active descendants on remount; sibling switching and repeated taps must remain deterministic without changing the captured appearance.
- Legacy resource dropdowns have a single open identity, native source buttons and outside/selection/Escape dismissal; stacked phone menus reserve space for open lists so both links and sibling triggers remain tappable.
- Shared navigation dimensions use font-independent CSS tokens; imported typography must not change the sidebar/content alignment.
- Use one shared logo loader for in-page loading (thumbnails, viewers), never for page navigation; keep thumbnail failures and unsupported formats as static file fallbacks so loading never masks an error.
- PDF thumbnails read a bounded, versioned browser Cache API cache before rendering; static HTML includes initial logo feedback on the first four cards, then viewport observers control feedback and PDF work so off-screen files do not compete.
- Keep filtered catalog arrays stable across unrelated updates and isolate the resource footer year update, preventing initial hydration updates from resetting gallery state or reparsing the resource shell.
- Shared document placeholders resolve through the common format parser and asset pointers; retain them until PDF image readiness or on failure, so pending and Office cards never need blank covers.
- Delay shared loading feedback only, never content readiness; remove indicators immediately on completion and keep overlays pointer-transparent so loading cannot block interaction.
- Use the shared MiniSearch tokenizer for all document catalogs; conservative aliases and AND matching keep abbreviations discoverable without loosening short class/year tokens.
- Document routes use URL-derived stable identities and lazy source-backed index shards; rebuild with scripts/build-document-index.py after adding or moving catalog records, so edited titles do not break existing links.
- Shared document cards own presentation filters and explicit pagination; source catalog values, layouts, record order, and original PDF destinations remain authoritative.
- Document catalogs use shared accessible cascading menus for presentation filters; repair malformed captured search inputs only at render time so audited source fragments stay unchanged.
- Document links carry URL-based originating catalog and browsing context; detail pages reuse the complete catalog and begin after the opened record so pagination remains continuous.
- Dedicated viewers auto-open PDFs using the captured flipbook in an isolated iframe; public source office files use format-aware external embeds with original-file fallbacks, keeping third-party legacy listeners scoped to the viewer lifetime.
- Document-format eligibility is shared by static catalog hydration, search and detail lookup; hide non-document records without mutating audited source shards. PDF reader options expose only supported reading tools, with shared React controls for mode, reload and fullscreen.
- Dedicated PDF readers use the source flipbook engine for flips and lazy PDF.js canvases in the isolated iframe for continuous vertical reading, because the source engine has no vertical mode.
- Static export for GitHub Pages: vite.config.ts prerenders "/" plus every path in the resource and legacy manifests (649 real .html files); the router uses trailingSlash: 'preserve' because the prerender pass requests "<path>/" and redirect normalization loops it. The deploy workflow copies index.html to 404.html so /doc/* deep links render client-side.
- GitHub Pages uses a single deploy workflow with pinned build runtimes and failure output in summaries/annotations, so deployment errors are diagnosable without private log access; verify repository-prefix compatibility before declaring a project Pages URL live.
- Static Pages deployments export every source asset pointer into the artifact at its exact URL using scripts/export-static-assets.py; validate MIME type and byte size and fail on unavailable originals, because GitHub cannot serve Lovable's asset proxy.
- Static pages install an inline early-tap queue in the root head that replays only the latest tap on a not-yet-hydrated control once React owns it, because prerendered pages show menus before JavaScript is ready.
- LibraryShell intercepts same-origin page links in content and routes them in-app (/index.html maps to /; Return/Back links use app history when present); the homepage door opens once per browser session via sessionStorage, so in-app returns show the shelves.
- One shared WhatsApp chat (src/components/whatsapp-chat.tsx, styles scoped in src/styles/whatsapp-chat.css) is mounted once by LibraryShell; page renderers strip captured per-page chat markup (homepage repair, legacy fragments, resource-shell floating-whatsapp) so the widget never duplicates.
- Route-scoped legacy stylesheets stay in route head() for SSR/prerender, but route components also call useRouteStylesheets (src/lib/route-stylesheets.ts), which adopts or creates the links on mount and removes every copy on unmount, because client-side navigation otherwise leaves them in <head> and their cascade breaks unrelated pages.
- One shared SiteFooter (src/components/site-footer.tsx, scoped styles in src/styles/site-footer.css) is rendered by LibraryShell inside main after page content; About/Disclaimer/Terms/Privacy are dedicated routes using the shared InfoPage so every page shows the same footer.
- Suppress captured footer nodes at legacy/resource render boundaries; isolate the shared footer calendar update in a hydration-safe hook and scope content-height overrides to static selections and homepage shelves, preserving audited sources and document layouts.
